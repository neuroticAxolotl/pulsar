# Pulsar
Pulsar is a bullet hell / shmup where instead of a gun, your only tool is a defective shield! The goal is to defeat bosses by deflecting their own projectiles back at them.
This was originally going to be a rhythm game, but apparently Godot isnt really suited for that...

Made for [(Not) A Strict Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/not-a-strict-jam-3).
